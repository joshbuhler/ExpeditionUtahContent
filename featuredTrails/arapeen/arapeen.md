# Utah Arapeen ATV Trail System

> The popular Utah Arapeen ATV Trail System, located 2 hours south of Salt Lake City, Utah on Highway 89, is a great family trail with plenty of advanced sections for experienced riders. It’s a great place to ride if you want to avoid the crowded canyons closer to the city. The Arapeen Trail can be accessed from one of seven canyons in the Sanpete Valley.
