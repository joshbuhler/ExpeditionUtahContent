> The Outlaw Trail was a large section of nearly two hundred miles. The Trail includes the area of Robbers Roost, Brown’s Hole and Hole-in-the-Wall. It was the refuge and hideout for Butch Cassidy’s gang from the 1880’s until the early 1900’s.
> 
> It was easy to hide there because of the many canyons and draws to hide in, and getting lost for someone not familiar with the area was easy. Another person familiar with Robbers Roost was Matt Warner. Warner would steal cattle and hideout in Robbers Roost. Others who knew and used the Robbers Roost were the McCarty (McCarthy) gang.
